# Fractpy

A fractal can be described as a complicated geometrical figure that unlike a conventional complicated figure does not simplify when magnified. Some of the properties of fractals are that it is self similar and has an intricate detailed structure. There are many techniques to generate fractals, one of which is the Newton Fractal, a type of escape-time fractal.

Fractpy is an open-source Python library which was developed to generate fractals of different kinds, and has currently implemented the Newton's Fractals. In the presentation I will be talking about the mathematics used in generating Newton's fractal and the reason why the fractal figures have to be as complicated as they look given what they represent which will make the final picture a lot more meaningful.

What makes this interesting is we call this type of fractal Newton's Fractal despite the fact Newton has no idea about any of this and could never see the images we can now with modern technology. This reflects how simple ideas, ones that could be discovered centuries ago, often hold within them some new angle waiting to be discovered hundreds of years later.

# Summary of Talk

### - Roots of Polynomial:
I will be starting by talking about one of the most basic problems in mathematics, finding the roots of a polynomial. And how there can't be a formula for roots of polynomials with degree five or above. After which I will introduce the Newton's method of apporximating roots, and where it fails.

### - Newton's Method in Complex Plane:
Now, using that same formula for approximating roots, when applied to each point in the complex plane and giving that point a colour based on which root it converges to is what makes the mind blowing fractal shapes. To help visualise this better I will be starting with limited number of points on the plane and seeing to which roots they converge and then gradually making a picture of high resolution.

### - Why does this make such complicated figure?
After seeing the figures generated the questions comes, why does it have to be so complicated? So I will be going over the boundary property for this type of fractal, which would give a strong intuition of why these figures have to look like this.

### - FractPy
In this section I'll be talking about the python library that my team and I developed for our University project - FractPy. This open-source library helps to plot Newton Fractals for any polynomial of give configuration. After which I will give a demo of the code. Also, being an open source library I will talk on how FractPy can be further developed.
